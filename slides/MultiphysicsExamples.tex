\begin{frame}{Multiphysics problems}
  \begin{block}{Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Saddle-point problems (\eg incompressibility, contact)
    \item Stiff waves (\eg low-Mach combustion)
    \item Mixed type (\eg radiation hydrodynamics, ALE free-surface flows)
    \item Multi-domain problems (\eg fluid-structure interaction)
    \item Full space PDE-constrained optimization
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Software/algorithmic considerations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Separate groups develop different ``physics'' components
    \item Do not know a priori which methods will have good algorithmic properties
    \item Achieving high throughput is more complicated
    \item Multiple time and/or spatial scales
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Splitting methods are delicate, often not in asymptotic regime
      \item Strongest nonlinearities usually non-stiff: prefer explicit for TVD limiters/shocks
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
